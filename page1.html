 <h1>Where it began</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>It began as version 1.6. This was the basic idea of the game, it was very popular among European players and quickly spread as it gained traction. 
        After 1.6, the full game came out, this included more maps, guns and looked a lot better. Keep in mind, this game came out in 1999, so there was only so much they could do at that time.</li>
