<h1>Famous players in the community</h1>
        <ul>
          <li>Some notable players; S1mple, Zywoo, Elige, Dev1ce, Gla1ve, Dupreeh. In my opinion, S1mple is the greatest player to ever touch the game of Counter-Strike.
            I watch a lot of the pro tournaments and when I tell you this guy is a god, he is a god. He does the unthinkable every game, things I couldn't even imagine doing to bots.
            If you ask anyone who the best team is in the history of Counter-Strike, they'll definitely say Astralis. That team has been through the most highs and lows.
            They have the most major wins, sitting at 4 wins, 2 of those back to back. I'm not even an Astralis fan and I can tell you that team is the greatest to ever do it.
            Astralis includes Gla1ve, Magisk, Dupreeh, Xyp9x, Dev1ce and their coach Zonic. Another notable player of 2020 is Zywoo, he was voted #1 by Hltv and he is still a rookie.
            He supposed to be the next S1mple, and he just might be. As a rookie, he still makes the pros look silly. </li>
