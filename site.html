    <h1>Info about the website</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>Hello! Counter-Strike is an objective-based, multiplayer first-person shooter. 
        Two opposing teams—the Terrorists and the Counter Terrorists—compete in game modes to complete objectives, such as securing a location to plant or defuse a bomb and rescuing or guarding hostages. 
        At the end of each round, players are rewarded based on their individual performance with in-game currency to spend on more powerful weapons in subsequent rounds. Winning rounds results in more money than losing, and completing objectives such as killing enemy players gives cash bonuses. 
        Uncooperative actions, such as killing teammates, results in a penalty. My website talks about the origin of Counter-Strike and how it was able to rise through the game rankings. Counter-Strike was the first popular game that follows the 5v5 fps 
        plant and diffuse shooter. Finally, I mention the pro scene of the game, I include famous pro players and their accomplishments.</li>
