  <h1>Where it began</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>It began as version 1.6. This was the basic idea of the game, it was very popular among European players and quickly spread as it gained traction. 
        After 1.6, the full game came out, this included more maps, guns and looked a lot better. Keep in mind, this game came out in 1999, so there was only so much they could do at that time.

<h1>How it became known</h1>
<ul>
        <li>It became know through various local tournaments, which evolved into even bigger tournaments involving huge amounts money and attendance. 
            It was popular because of the nuances it incorporated, it was an industrial revolution for the gaming community. It established a new genre of video game.
    Copies of Counter-Strike, such as Valorant, would not even be a thing. In January, after 22 years since 1.6, it averaged 81,000 viewers on Twitch.

<h1>Famous players/teams in the community</h1>
        <ul>
          <li> Some notable players; S1mple, Zywoo, Elige, Dev1ce, Gla1ve, Dupreeh. In my opinion, S1mple is the greatest player to ever touch the game of Counter-Strike.
            I watch a lot of the pro tournaments and when I tell you this guy is a god, he is a god. He does the unthinkable every game, things I couldn't even imagine doing to bots.
            If you ask anyone who the best team is in the history of Counter-Strike, they'll definitely say Astralis. That team has been through the most highs and lows.
            They have the most major wins, sitting at 4 wins, 2 of those back to back. I'm not even an Astralis fan and I can tell you that team is the greatest to ever do it.
            Astralis includes Gla1ve, Magisk, Dupreeh, Xyp9x, Dev1ce and their coach Zonic. Another notable player of 2020 is Zywoo, he was voted #1 by Hltv and he is still a rookie.
            He supposed to be the next S1mple, and he just might be. As a rookie, he still makes the pros look silly.
